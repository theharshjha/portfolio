                Hello! I’m a computer science student with a strong interest in backend and low-level programming,
                driven by a desire to understand technology from the ground up. I’m proficient in C++ and JavaScript and
                currently learning Golang, and have a solid foundation in core computer science subjects like DBMS,
                Networking, etc.
                </br>
                </br>
                Computer Programmign is all Abstractions, but to me I have love-hate relationship wiht them. While I
                enjoy creating them, I find they often cloud the learning process, making it harder to connect directly
                with the system’s true workings. I prefer to dive into the details, understanding the fundamentals and
                seeing how everything fits together at the core.
                </br>
                </br>
                I have a deep passion for algorithmic problem-solving, so much so that I can lose track of time while
                immersed in it, without a second thought. I regularly participate in competitive programming contests,
                constantly challenging myself to tackle complex problems and sharpen my skills.
                </br>
                </br>
                When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me outdoors, enjoying some fresh air and a change of pace.
